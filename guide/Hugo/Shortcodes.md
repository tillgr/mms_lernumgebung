# Shortcodes

Hugo comes equipped with a bunch of predefined shortcodes (e.g.: YouTube video embedding)

How to use them:

```bash
{{< [shortcode-name] [parameter] >}}
```

Use the YouTube shortcode as an example:

```bash
{{< youtube [id] >}}
```

ℹ️ `id` is the video-id from youtube. (can be copied from the url)

Here are the built-in shortcodes:
