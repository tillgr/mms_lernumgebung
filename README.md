# ‚ÑπÔ∏è General Information
At the beginning of the project, we analyzed the old site thoroughly and summarized this in a small documentation, which serves as a good starting point for the project.

You can find the documentation here: #27

We also created a summary of topics for future developers under %5

# üóÉÔ∏è Project Structure
HUGO has a specific folder structure we can take advantage of. For more information see also: [Directory-structure in HUGO](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/)

It is important to know that we seperated the content from the styling. So we created our own HUGO theme ([here is explained how](https://retrolog.io/blog/creating-a-hugo-theme-from-scratch/)). You can find it here:
```
themes/mmsTheme
```

Everything related to styling the app lives here. So if you want th change a styling you have to change the theme!

If you want to add a .css-file you should add it here:
```
themes/mmsTheme/static/css
```
(‚ö†Ô∏è Dont forget to include it in the HTML-file!)

### Applets
We created the applest as shortcodes which live here:

The js-code:
```
static/js
```
The styling files:
```
static/css
themes/mmsTheme/static/css
```
The assets:
```
static/assets
```
The HTML:
```
layouts/shortcodes/snippets
```

# üß¨ Shortcodes
To harness the full power of HUGO we have introduced our own shortcodes. We have documented them here (#37) and provided examples.

You can also find a short guide about what they are and how to use them.

You can find them in our created theme, here:
```
themes/mmsTheme/layouts/shortcodes
```

<hr>

# üé® Styleguide
We created a styling guide for our project. It is included as a subproject in this one and can be found here:
```
/design/styleguide/
```

The folder includes a README.md with more information on how to use it.
