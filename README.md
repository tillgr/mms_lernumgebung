# ‚ÑπÔ∏è General Information
At the beginning of the project, we analyzed the old site thoroughly and summarized this in a small documentation, which serves as a good starting point for the project.

You can find the documentation here: #27

We also created a summary of topics for future developers under %5

# üß¨ Shortcodes
